Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000(primary key: id)
ii. Hours = 1562(foreign key: business_id)
iii. Category = 2643(foreign key: business_id)
iv. Attribute = 1115(foreign key: business_id)
v. Review = 10000(primary key: id)
vi. Checkin = 493(foreign key: business_id)
vii. Photo = 10000(primary key: id)
viii. Tip = 3979(foreign key: business_id)
ix. User = 10000(primary key: id)
x. Friend = 11(foreign key: user_id)
xi. Elite_years = 2780(foreign key: user_id)

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: No

iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT city, category, stars, postal_code,
CASE
    WHEN stars BETWEEN 2.0 AND 3.0 THEN  '1'
    WHEN stars BETWEEN 4.0 AND 5.0 THEN  '2'
END AS GR
FROM ((business
INNER JOIN category ON business.id=category.business_id)

WHERE city == 'Mesa'
GROUP BY postal_code
ORDER BY GR DESC
+------+--------------------------+-------+-------------+----+
| city | category                 | stars | postal_code | GR |
+------+--------------------------+-------+-------------+----+
| Mesa | Gluten-Free              |   4.0 | 85204       | 2  |
| Mesa | Restaurants              |   5.0 | 85210       | 2  |
| Mesa | Cannabis Clinics         |   4.5 | 85215       | 2  |
| Mesa | Mobile Phone Accessories |   2.0 | 85206       | 1  |
+------+--------------------------+-------+-------------+----+
We can see that district which postal code is 85206 always give low ratings.		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.

FROM business
GROUP BY name
HAVING is_open = 0
ORDER BY stars DESC
	
i. Difference 1:
7489 open, 1438 not open, different distribution.

ii. Difference 2:
High rating distribution is different, for those are still open, there are 4153, for those are closed, there are 642, which makes sense.

SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT name,stars, SUM(review_count),is_open
FROM business
WHERE is_open=0
GROUP BY name
HAVING stars BETWEEN 4.0 AND 5.0
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
Sentiment analysis         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
I need to do text mining to see how many people have positive reviews, and how many negative reviews.
And then I would compare the results with the rating and to create a model to predict overall ratings, I would split data into training, validation and test sets to test the accuracy.
	                           
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
+-----------+-----------+
| love_text | hate_text |
+-----------+-----------+
|      1780 |       232 |
+-----------+-----------+   
         
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:
	SELECT (SELECT COUNT(text)
	FROM review
	WHERE text like "%love%") AS  love_text, 
	(SELECT COUNT(text) 
	FROM review
	WHERE text like "%hate%") AS hate_text
